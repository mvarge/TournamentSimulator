# Tournament Simulator

This project is intended to be an experiment for random probabilities calculation between different levels of teams, as 
well as a demonstration over the [Round-Robin tournament algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin_tournament), 
used to randomize matches between all teams within a given tournament.
